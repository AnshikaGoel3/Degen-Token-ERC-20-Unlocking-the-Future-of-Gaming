# Degen Token (ERC-20): Unlocking the Future of Gaming

Degen Gaming, a renowned game studio, wants to create a unique ERC20 token on the Avalanche blockchain to reward players. This token can be earned by players in the game and exchanged for rewards in their in-game store. 

## Description
In this project, we have to create an ERC20 token for Degen Gaming and deploy it on the Avalanche network. The smart contract should include the following functionalities:

1. Minting New Tokens: The platform should be able to create new tokens and distribute them to players as rewards. Only the owner can mint tokens.
2. Transferring Tokens: Players should be able to transfer their tokens to others.
3. Redeeming Tokens: Players should be able to redeem their tokens for items in the in-game store.
4. Checking Token Balance: Players should be able to check their token balance at any time.
5. Burning Tokens: Anyone should be able to burn tokens that they own and no longer need.
